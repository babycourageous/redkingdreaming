This retelling of the Phaedra / Hippolytus story brings a whole new meaning to the phrase "motherly love" as one unripe peach supplied by a curious talking ram in the woods drives the Queen of Athens into a lust that ultimately brings down her entire family. The play is a stand-alone piece. But it is also serves as the second in a pair of plays that comprise a larger story using one mythic family to explore personal agency & fate called Fatalism.
