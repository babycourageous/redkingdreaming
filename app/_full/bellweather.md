The disappearance of 6-year old Amy Draft shocks the modern, affluent suburb of Inverness. And as questions go unanswered, initially sympathetic neighbors begin to whisper suspiciously about the girl's distraught parents, Alan and Jackie. When the abduction abruptly leaps in magnitude, the entire community unravels into a seething mass of confusion and media frenzy. As Alan is left to battle the growing mob outside, Jackie must confront an untenable choice in order to rescue her daughter.
