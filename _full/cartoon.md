Join the exploits of a band of mismatched cartoon stereotypes on a wild ride through an animated world. Presented in the style of a Commedia dell'Arte scenario gone berserk. CARTOON is a devilishly violent social commentary that explores the rapid coalescence of media, politics and consumer giants. A young, idealistic upstart named Trouble steals the giant hammer that Esther, the bratty dictator, uses to maintain a monotonous but peaceful order. Chaos ensues. Bombs explode. Puppets are set free. Anime girls fight. And as the bodies pile up, the violence begins to creep off the stage and into the audience. There's nothing like a punch in the face to really get the blood moving. Available from Samuel French.
