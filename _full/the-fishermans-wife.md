Vanessa and Cooper Minnow have a marriage that's grown stale. She wants excitement, passion. He merely wants to provide for her the best way he knows how: fishing. While Cooper is out at sea, Vanessa receives a visit from a mysterious traveling salesman with a bag full of danger. And he's not the only one new in town: a squid and octopus have settled in under the dock, ready to sexually assault anyone who happens their way. Drawing inspiration from the foremost example of tentacle porn, Hokusai's famous 200-year-old Japanese woodcut The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, this sex farce with sea creatures is a brutally hilarious fable about how to make a marriage last.
