Place: America. Time: America. An epic solar eclipse marks the end of history and the beginning of life - as presented on television. While a fledgling Eden tries to bloom in one suburban living room, the desperate memory of something grand savagely bangs on the door. A muted husband, his struggling wife, a terrified single mother, her prescient son, a traveling salesman, a bourbon-soaked radio announcer and everyone at the local television affiliate collide and unravel under darkened skies in this crush of realism, allegory and American myth.
