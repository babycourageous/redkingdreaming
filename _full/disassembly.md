Evan is what you would call accident-prone. Having suffered from various injuries his entire life, he's now been stabbed in the shoulder. In his apartment, his sister and his fianc√© are trying to help him recover while fending off a steady stream of visitors as well as a bitter neighbor with a thing for stuffed cats. But something isn't quite adding up and Evan's apartment is a hub of secrets, lies and all out brawls from which no one emerges unscathed.
