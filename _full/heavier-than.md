This mash-up of Greek myth unfolds in the heart of a labyrinth where Aster the Minotaur contemplates turning 30 in a world that sees him as nothing more than a murderous oddity. He must navigate the impending arrival of warriors out to kill him, a deceptive chorus, a plotting sister, and a sexually obsessed boy with wings, all while pining for his estranged mother. The play is a stand-alone piece. But it is also serves as the first in a pair of plays that comprise a larger story using one mythic family to explore personal agency & fate called Fatalism.
