Ben is a timid young city-dweller who freaks out when his roommate Jack brings home a big bad wolf for a one-night stand. When he tries to rescue Jack, Ben sets into motion a dangerous chain of events that will alter the world as they know it. Throw in a peculiar narrator who knows more than she's letting on, and this savagely funny fairy tale for grown-ups twists and turns toward a breathtaking climax. A play about the comfort of lava lamps, the trouble with a handy axe, and the dangers of stories we tell ourselves over an over.
