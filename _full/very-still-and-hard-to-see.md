Architect Buck Mason makes a less than flattering deal with a secret creature hidden deep in the ground below his newest building. He gains his deepest desire and, in exchange, she takes up "occupancy" in his building. A magical, darkly funny, and occasionally surreal creation that will take you on an exhilarating, visceral journey through decades in the life of a hotel that has the misfortune of hosting otherworldly guests with less than friendly agendas. Available along with collected short plays form Samuel French.
