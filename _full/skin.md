Lust takes the lead in this take-no-prisoners exploration of fidelity and want. Five people find out what happens when desire eclipses common sense, sex is confused with love and identity is slowly overtaken by creeping weakness in this voyeuristic jaunt. For adult audiences only. Commissioned by Dad's Garage Theatre Company.
