This short play cycle in five parts throws a group of people into a dark dreamscape of unreliable reality, fluid time, jellyfish, spilled milk, hidden fears and stereo headphones. The interconnected stories take place in an apartment, the hotel across the street, and the intersection between them. Characters come together, come apart, come unhinged, and come to realize that just maybe they are all trapped in the same dream. Commissioned by Dad's Garage Theatre Company.
