In the wake of a local tragedy, single mother Elizabeth Miller and her withdrawn son Bailey try to jump-start their relationship across the breakfast table. But with berserker appliances, shifting astronomy, the talkative new family dog, and some noisy, angry forces threatening to invade her kitchen, Elizabeth might not be able to really "see" the person she needs to see most. This mix of mythology, astronomy, and modern American culture gets at the heart of the havoc that can happen sometimes when people stop talking because it's easier to just let things go.
